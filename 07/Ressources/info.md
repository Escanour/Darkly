## How to see it

Go on the page mentionned before.
So first of all why and what is a robots.txt file. This is a file which contains the IP adress of part of your website you don't
want to be public. This is mostly checked by the navigators so these pages don't get printed by google, yahoo...
I'll let you search a bit on how to use this one :) but you'll get to a really sexy page saying that you won!

GOOD JOB HERE IS THE FLAG : B9E775A0291FED784A2D9680FCFAD7EDD6B8CDF87648DA647AAF4BBA288BCAB3
```

## How to abuse of it

Redirect you not to the expected website, by aspiring their frontend create a site which looks like it and which could steal all your infos that you could enter on this one feeling secured.

## How to patch it

You'll need to protect this file :) And try not to put your root infos in this one
