## How to see it

Go on the page mentionned before.
Inspect element and then go in the main content and read commentary! Here is the link of a fun one ;).
Unfortunatelu only available for french speaker https://pastebin.com/FNK044v3 .
You'll find after this one a commentary syaing that you have to come from the NASA and from the ft_bornToSec browser.
We will use the script given in this way.
Wtach out the URL asked and the server might change.

```bash
sh script.sh | grep "flag"
```
And you will have this result appearing 

```bash
<center><h2 style="margin-top:50px;"> The flag is : f2a29020ef3132e01dd61df97fd33ec8d7fcd1388cc9601e7db691d17d4d6188</h2><br/><img src="images/win.png" alt="" width=200px height=200px></center> <audio id="best_music_ever" src="audio/music.mp3"preload="true" loop="loop" autoplay="autoplay">
