# 08_I_script_so_I_can

For this one we are going to find the good READ_ME.md which is hiding :(
Here is the URL
http://192.168.99.100/.hidden/

## How to see it

Go on the page mentionned before.
As you might have seen, there is a lot of README hidden, approximately 26^3 ~ 17000
And only 1 contains the hidden flag, so we will try to find it :)
Don't worry you don't have to do it by hand, a script is linked to the folder
Watch-out the script is using the IP of the server so the one in might need to be changed!
If the script is not working make sure you have all dependencies (wget...)

```bash
sh script.sh
```
After a long time, and way too many lines printing you'll see the final result with the so much desired key ;)

```bash

```

## How to abuse of it

Learn bash

## How to patch it

Hide it better :(
